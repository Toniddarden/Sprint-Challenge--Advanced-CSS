      <h2>Lift Off</h2>

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
        marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate,
        that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe,
        having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>

      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as
        equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic.
          The Earth was absolutely round.</p>

        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye,
          and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>

<!-- 
  1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
      - Adaptive website: A more distinctive layout designed for multiple screens.
      - Responsive website: The site already adapts to the screen no matter the size of the screen. The layout is more flexible to fit all screen sizes. 
 
2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
 
      - Mobile first means designing a site that will be used more on a mobile phone rather than a computer screen. Designing the layout to fit best with mobile devices. 
 
3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
      - 1.6rem

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
      - It helps you create more detailed CSS without having to write as much code to get it done. It does the compiling for you so you can focus on the detailed code. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
      - Nesting is my favorite. Parametrics give me the most trouble because I am not 100% comfortable with parameters.
